      <p>The Cayde-6 Sect is a Looking For Group application mostly reserved for the group The Technodrome in Bungie’s flagship game Destiny.
        With hundreds of thousands of video game players in Destiny, it can get a bit crowded and in need of a filter to find players
        looking for the same activity and team-coordination.</p>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>Go to “New LFG Post” fill out your Console, Gamertag and other info to list yourself under the activity you’d like to find a group for.
          Posts last on average 30-40 minutes to keep things fresh and 0 clutter. </p>
          <h2>Why donate?</h2>
          <p>To keep the server running smoothly with tolerable speeds.
            This is on a budget so if you enjoy using it feel free to help out in dedicated server funds!</p>
